# Create an API for an Express App

## Intro

Looking for some more practice exposing an API for an app?  Good!

## Lab Requirements

1. Get in the **.../starter-code/mongoose-movies** folder inside of this lab's folder in the class repo.

2. Install the Node modules: `$ npm install`.

3. Create a RESTful API for the `movies` resource that includes all 5 RESTful routes.

4. The `cast` property of each _movie_ document must be populated with the _performer_ documents.

5. Collaborate and smile.

## Bonus

- Expose a full RESTful API for the  `performers` resource as well.

## Deliverable

#### This lab is not a deliverable!
